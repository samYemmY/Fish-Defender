In Fishtank Trouble you and up to seven friends of the sea can dive into the fish tank and live the fishy dream!

You can be one of the unsuspecting ichthyoid inhabitants of the tank wandering their way across the sandy surface in search of the next bit of fish food to fill your belly - but to spice things up one or two players will take control of the guardian towers whose task it is to keep them fishes hungry!
